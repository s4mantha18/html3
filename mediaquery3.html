                <small class="kirainfo2">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've <br>never written a line of code. I needed</br> some structure from professionals</br> who can help me learn programming</br>
                     step by step. I was encouraged to</br> enroll by a farmer student of theirs</br>
                     who can anly say wonderful things</br> about the program. The entire</br>
                     curriculum and staff did not </br>
                     disappoint. They were very hands-on</br> and I never had to wait long for </br>
                     assistance. The agile team project, in</br> particular, was outstanding. It took</br>
                    my learning to the next level in a way</br> that no tutorial could ever have in</br>fact, I've often referred to it during</br>
                     interviews as an example of my</br> developent experience. It certainty</br>
                     helped me land a job as a full-stack</br>developer after receiving multiple</br> offers. 100% recommend!"</small>
